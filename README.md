# Heap Sort
## Description

A program demonstrating the heap sort algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

Program can be run from a Windows or Linux Terminal.  (For Linux, be sure to have a C++ compiler installed.  
Will need to create an object file using the "g++ -o ..." command on the main.cpp file).  The usage is:
```
HeapSort.exe num1 num2 num3 num4 ...
```
...where "num1", "num2", etc are integers.  These integers are passed into the program as arguments and 
sorted using the heap sort algorithm.
